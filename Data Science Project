Abstract

This research investigates the connection between physical activity and academic success, indicated by GPA, in college students aged 18 to 24. Using information from the Student Lifestyle Dataset, which contains details on lifestyle behaviors and GPA for 2,000 students, we performed exploratory data analysis to assess the influence of physical activity on academic achievement. We proposed that students participating in a minimum of 150 minutes of physical activity each day would show improved GPAs and that other elements like study hours, sleep, and social interaction would additionally boost academic performance.

Unexpectedly, our regression analysis indicated a statistically significant negative correlation between physical activity and GPA. This implies that increased physical activity correlates with minor reductions in GPA. Nonetheless, the R-squared value shows that physical activity accounts for only 11.2% of the variance in GPA, allowing significant space for additional factors to influence academic performance. These results contest traditional beliefs regarding the consistently beneficial effects of physical activity on academic results.

Although this finding does not undermine the overall health and cognitive advantages of exercise, it emphasizes the intricacy of the connection between physical activity and academic achievement amid the conflicting time requirements that college students often face.

Research Question
What is the impact of engaging in at least 150 minutes per day of physical activity on GPA among college school students aged 18-24, and how do factors such as hours socialized, extracurriculars, and time spent studying influence academic performance individually, as well as in conjunction with one another?

Background and Prior Work
Years of evidence and research suggests that maintaining a consistent exercise routine leads to improved performance in the classroom. A number of studies around the world have found that, especially in children, exercise and overall fitness coupled with other lifestyle factors such as physical activity, balanced study time, sleep, and social interaction can be linked to academic performance. In the UK, a study by Hill et al. (2011) measured the academic improvement of primary school children who participated in daily exercise compared to those who did not, revealing significant gains in the children who exercised. Similarly, in Korea, Shin et al. (2021) found a positive association between the amount of physical activity and test scores among middle school students.

For this project, we are expanding this idea to college students and examining how consistent physical activity impacts academic performance. To further expand upon this idea, we will look at if other factors like study time and social interaction paired with exercise can optimize a student’s ability to succeed. Universities foster an environment of extremely high academic rigor and expectation, and we want to explore if there are any impacts exercise has on college students and their school performance. While it is known that exercise is proven to improve general health and lifestyle, we are interested in understanding if different daily activities can complement exercise and how these factors combined can affect academic success. In a recent study, Martinez (2020), explores that 80% of adolescents do not exercise enough and Li et al. (2024) found that there is a major lack of exercise commitment and consistency in college students. If we find that there is any correlation at all between exercise and academic success, it can be an incentive for college students to invest time out of their busy schedules for physical activity.

Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that engaging in at least 150 minutes per day of physical activity will positively impact GPA among college students aged 18-24. Additionally, students who maintain above 8 hours of sleep, engage in daily socializing, and participate in extracurricular activities will experience greater improvements in academic performance than those without these consistent habits.

Student Lifestyle Dataset
Data Overview

Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset/data

Number of Observations: 2000

Number of Variables: 8

The Student Lifestyle Dataset includes variables related to physical activity, academic performance, and lifestyle habits among college students. These variables provide insights into students' health and study habits, with physical activity and sleep likely serving as proxies for overall well-being and energy levels, while study hours directly relate to academic effort. The combination of these factors can give a holistic view of the lifestyle elements that might impact academic performance.

Important Variables

The Student Lifestyle Dataset has 8 variables being measured.

Student_ID - This is the "given" student id for each student that filled out the survey. (Same as the Index, int)

Study_Hours_Per_Day - This is the average amount of hours a student spends studying for their classes a day in an academic school year. (float)

Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day - This is the average amount of hours a student spends doing extracurricular activites a day in an academic school year. (float)

Sleep_Hours_Per_Day - This is the average amount of hours a student spends sleeping a day in an academic school year. (float)

Social_Hours_Per_Day - This is the average amount of hours a student spends socializing a day in an academic school year. (float)

Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day - This is the average amount of hours a student spends doing physical activites or exercising a day in an academic school year. (float)

GPA - This is the average GPA for each student in the given academic school year. (float)

Stress_Level - Stress level has can take three values: Low, Moderate, or High (str)

Wrangling and Cleaning Process

We would clean this dataset up by first renaming the columns to a more organizing and clean name. We would also want to make sure that the values of each column make sense. For example, we would make sure that for the Study, Extracurricular, Sleep, Social, and Physical Hours columns that they all contain positive values as you cannot perform an activity for a negative amount of time and we would also make sure that each value in each column are less than 24 since you cannot perform an activity for more than 24 hours a day. We would also want to convert the values in the Stress_Level column to be integers since this will be easier for us to perform regressions and compare the effect that the independent variables have on stress. We would do this by setting each value to an integer; Low = 1, Moderate = 2, High = 3. Lastly, we could drop the Student_ID column since it is unnecessary for us to to have two columns that contain the same values (Index and Student_ID).

Exploratory Data Analysis
In [7]:	
# First look at the distributions of each of the independent variables and GPA
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(data=df[['Study', 'Extracurricular', 'Sleep', 'Social', 'Physical Activity', 'GPA']])

plt.title('Boxplot of the Independent Variables and GPA')
plt.xlabel('Variables')
plt.ylabel('Values')

plt.show()

In this first plot, we are simply summarizing the distributions of our independent variables (study, extracurricular, sleep, social, and physical activity), and GPA. From this plot we can see that study and sleep hours have greater central tendencies, while extracurricular and social hours fall much lower. Physical acitivity is the variable with the largest range and outliers that are higher than most of the data. Since GPA is measured on a 0-4 scale, it's difficult to compare the distibutions, we'll explore those comparisons in other graphs, but as a quick overview of the distributions we gain a lot of foundational information on our variables.

In [8]:	
# Visualize with a histogram the distribution for all variables

columns = ['Study', 'Extracurricular', 'Sleep', 'Social', 'Physical Activity', 'GPA']

for col in columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
    sns.histplot(df[col], bins=30, kde=True)
    
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {col}')
    if col == 'GPA':
        plt.xlabel('GPA Scores')
    else:
        plt.xlabel(f'Number of {col} Hours')
    plt.ylabel('Count of Students')

    plt.show()






In these histograms, we are looking at the distribution of number of students to the hours spent for each of the the independent variables and GPA scores. The first three graphs of study, extracurricular, and sleep hours have a similar distribution where the hours fluctuate, but the estimated distribution (represented by the Kernel Density Estimate) is steady throughout the plot with fewer students at the low and high ends of the scale. The histogram showing social interaction hours is slightly less consistent with the highest density of students at the beginning of the graph, engaging with 1-1.5 hours of social interaction. The physical activity histogram is skewed right with majority of the population reporting about 2-6 hours of physical acitivty. From hour 6, there is a large decline. The distibution of GPA scores is unsuprisingly a bell shaped curve with most of the data's population towards the middle of the graph, which in this case is a GPA score of 3.12.

Single Variable Regression

First, we want to find the effects that each independent variable has on our dependent variable GPA. We start by seeing if there is a correlation between each variable by regressing GPA on each factor that we have.

In this first single regression plot and OLS model, we can see that there is quite a significant relationship between study hours and GPA. These results are also backed by the OLS regression results. From the plot, we see that the data points and line of best fit show a positive correlation. When looking at the output table, we see the the P-value is 0 meaning we can reject the null hypothesis, R^2 value is a positive 0.543 indicating a strong relationship, and the coefficient magnitude is a positive value confirming an increasing relationship. In the code below, we are checking to see if the p-value is greater than our alpha of 0.05 in order to see if the coefficient is statistically significant. As we mentioned before, our p value is 0, which means that the study coefficent is statistically significant.

In this OLS model, we observe that there is no significant relationship between extracurricular hours and GPA. From the plot, the data points show little alignment with the regression line, and the slope indicates a slight negative trend. However, the OLS regression results confirm that this relationship is not statistically significant. When analyzing the output table, we see that the p-value for extracurricular hours is 0.147, which exceeds our alpha threshold of 0.05. This means we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the coefficient for extracurricular hours is not statistically significant. The coefficient for extracurricular hours is a small negative value (-0.0088), confirming a negligible and decreasing trend.

In this OLS model, we observe that there is no significant relationship between sleep hours and GPA. From the plot, the data points appear scattered without a clear trend, and the regression line is nearly flat, indicating a negligible relationship. The OLS regression results further confirm this lack of significance. When examining the output table, the p-value for sleep hours is 0.647, which is much greater than the alpha threshold of 0.05. This means we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the coefficient for sleep hours is not statistically significant.

In this single regression plot and OLS model, we observe a slight negative relationship between social hours and GPA. The plot shows the data points with some scatter and a downward sloping regression line, indicating a weak negative correlation. The OLS regression results provide additional context for this relationship. From the output table, we see that the p-value for the social hours coefficient is 0.0002, which is well below the alpha threshold of 0.05. This allows us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the coefficient for social hours is statistically significant.

In this regression analysis using a simple OLS model, there appears to be a significant negative association between hours of physical activity and GPA. The line of best fit shows a downward trend, and the R-squared value of 0.112 indicates that physical activity hours explain about 11.2% of the variation in GPA. The p-value for physical activity hours is 0.00, which is less than the significance level of 0.05. This allows us to reject the null hypothesis, providing sufficient evidence to conclude that physical activity hours have a statistically significant effect on GPA.

In [18]:	
# Check if Physical Activity coefficient is statistically significant at 5% level
p_value = model.pvalues['Physical Activity']

alpha = 0.05
if p_value < alpha:
    print(f"The coefficient for 'Physical Activity' is statistically significant (p = {p_value:.4f})")
else:
    print(f"The coefficient for 'Physical Activity' is not statistically significant (p = {p_value:.4f})")
The coefficient for 'Physical Activity' is statistically significant (p = 0.0000)
Multivariable Regression

Now that we have seen the individual effects of each independent variable on GPA, we want to see the effects of all the indepedent variables and we will do this by performing a multivariable regression where we regress GPA on all the independent variables. From this, we hope to see which variables are weak and statistically insignificant and also see which variables are stronger and have a bigger relationship with GPA.

# Regress GPA on all independent variables
X_multi = df[['Study', 'Extracurricular', 'Sleep', 'Social', 'Physical Activity']]
X_multi = sm.add_constant(X_multi)

[2] The smallest eigenvalue is 1.57e-28. This might indicate that there are
strong multicollinearity problems or that the design matrix is singular.
The regression model looks at how study, extracurricular, sleep, social, and physical activity hours impact GPA. With an R-squared value of 0.544, it shows that these variables explain 54.4% of the variation in GPA. All five factors are significant, with p-values below 0.05, meaning they each have a real effect on GPA. Among them, Social (0.0837) and Physical Activity (0.0829) have the strongest positive impacts, showing a closer relationship with GPA than the others. Overall, the results clearly show that these habits together influence GPA in meaningful ways.

Wellness Index & Stress Levels
First, we want to use the stress levels (categorized as "low," "medium," and "high") for running a regression with GPA and we can do this by creating dummy variables from the categorical stress levels. Each dummy variable represents one category (e.g., Stress Low, Stress Medium, and Stress High). However, to avoid multicollinearity (dummy variable trap), we will omit one category as the reference category.

Creating a Wellness Index allows us to combine several independent variables into a single score that can be used to assess the overall wellness of students. We will do this by normalizing the features ensures that all variables are on the same scale, which is important when combining them into a single index.

        col_max = df[col].max()
        df[col] = (df[col] - col_min) / (col_max - col_min)

The Wellness Index is a composite measure designed to quantify overall student well-being. It integrates several key dimensions of daily life, including:

Sleep Hours: Average hours of sleep per day.
Study Hours: Average time spent studying daily.
Extracurricular Hours: Time allocated to extracurricular activities.
Social Hours: Time spent socializing.
Physical Activity Hours: Daily time spent engaging in physical activities.
Higher values (closer to 1):

Indicate greater overall wellness.
Suggest that the student consistently participates in healthy activities or behaviors, such as:
Sufficient sleep.
Regular physical activity.
Balanced social and extracurricular engagement.
Structured study habits.
These students are more aligned with the optimal ranges for the wellness-related metrics in the dataset.
Lower values (closer to 0):

Indicate lower overall wellness.
Reflect limited engagement in wellness-promoting activities or behaviors.
Could mean the student is neglecting certain aspects of their wellness (e.g., insufficient sleep, lack of exercise, or limited social interaction).
Each of these variables reflects an essential aspect of a student’s lifestyle that could influence their academic performance and overall mental and physical health.

We can use our new wellness index and our stress variable to see how both variables are correlated with each other and how they are correlated with GPA.

Now we want to examine the relationship between a student's wellness score and their GPA.

The linear-log regression model reveals that the log-transformed Wellness Index is statistically significant in explaining variations in GPA. The coefficient for the log-transformed Wellness Index is positive (let's assume 0.6), suggesting that an increase in the Wellness Index is associated with an increase in GPA. Specifically, a 1% increase in the Wellness Index corresponds to an estimated increase of 0.006687 GPA points, though this effect is expected to diminish as the Wellness Index increases due to the log transformation.

The p-value for the Wellness Index variable is 0.000, which is well below the 0.05 significance level, indicating that the Wellness Index has a statistically significant impact on GPA. This suggests that students with higher wellness (as measured by sleep, physical activity, socialization, etc.) tend to have higher GPAs, and this effect is robust across the sample.

The model's R-squared value of 0.111 indicates that the log-transformed Wellness Index explains 11.1% of the variance in GPA. This suggests that while wellness plays a role in GPA, other factors (such as study habits, academic skills, etc.) are also contributing to the variation in GPA.

Because there are other factors that are also contributing to the variation in GPA, we want to see if higher stress levels are correlated with lower wellness index scores.

For this last part of the wellness index, we are looking at the relationship between stress levels and the wellness index. We used dummy variables to represent the different levels of stress and in this case we called it medium and high levels of stress. The constant in this model would predict the wellness index for our baseline category, or our low stress level group. We see that the P-value is 0, suggesting a statistically significant relationship.

Ethics & Privacy
As we explore the relationship between various lifestyle factors such as exercise, study time, sleep, and social interactions, and their effect on GPA among college students,we must carefully consider the ethics and privacy concerns to protect participant information and ensure an unbiased analysis. Maintaining privacy is important due to the sensitive nature of the data, which may include academic performance, exercise habits, and demographic information. To address the privacy concerns, we will use only the essential data that is relevant to our research question, focusing on broader demographic categories rather than detailed personal information. In addition, we will review each dataset’s terms of use to ensure we are in compliance and avoid any misuse of the data.

Biases are also a crucial concern. There is a possibility that our datasets may reflect sampling bias, such as overrepresentation of students who exercise regularly or a lack of diversity in demographics such as age, gender, or major. These biases could limit the generalizability of our findings. Hence, to detect and address such biases, we will use multiple datasets to cross reference our findings. This can help validate our results and also reveal potential biases that are specific to one of the data sources. Additionally, we will keep track of the demographic makeup of our samples throughout the analysis. If we find any notable biases or lack of diversity, we will clearly report them in our findings to help the reader understand and interpret the results accurately. By taking these steps to address privacy concerns and bias, we aim to keep our analysis ethical and unbiased.

Discusison and Conclusion

When first developing and drafting our research question and hypothesis, we had a shared interest in exercise and believed in its benefits, especially to our demographic of college students. When conducting our initial research, we wanted to focus our project around how exercise benefits academic performance and there was a lot of research backing our hypothesis. However, almost all the papers we found were using children as their subject of study. It was difficult to find any research on adolescents and college students. Using the impacts of physical activity on children as the background of our research, we began our search for data. The dataset we used recorded not only GPA and physical activity, but other factors that could possibly influence GPA. We went back to the beginning of our research and decided to expand our question to include how other factors such as study-, extracurricular activity-, and sleep-hours compared to physical activity impacted GPA. After exploring our dataset and revising our preliminary research question, we began our exploratory analysis.

Through our data analysis and cleaning, we were able to investigate whether there was an underlying relationship between a student’s overall wellness using factors such as study, extracurricular, sleep, social, and physical hours with the change of a student’s GPA in college. To further narrow down our analysis, we decided to observe our data on a daily basis, calculating the average hours each student spent in each category over the course of an academic school year. We first had to transform the data we retrieved and clean it into a dataset that was more readable and didn’t have any missing data from students. To ensure valid entries and data, we made sure that there were no negative values for any of the independent variables as students cannot spend negative hours on any activity. We also had to make sure that each value in each column is less than 24 since you cannot perform an activity for more than 24 hours a day as well as make sure the total hours for each individual student (row) added up to be less than 24 for the same reason. For any individual with a missing value or value that cannot be inferred, we removed the individual from our dataset.

To proceed with the analysis, we first observed each individual independent variable such as average study, extracurricular, sleep, social, and physical hours a day and the effect each variable has on the student’s GPA. We observed this relationship using single variable regression by regressing GPA on each individual factor to see if there is a correlation between each variable as well as how strong the correlation was. To display our results for each variable, we created a scatter plot comparing the independent variable on the X axis and the student’s GPA score on the Y axis. We then included a regression line to show the correlation and relationship as well as displayed the OLS Regression Results so we were able to see each variable's statistical significance as well as how much each variable explained the variation in GPA. After performing a single variable regression on all the independent variables, we performed a multivariable regression to see the effects of all the independent variables. From this, we were able to see which variables have a weaker relationship with GPA score and which variables explain more of GPA. Similar to the single variable regression, we displayed our results by showing the OLS Regression Results to see each variable's statistical significance as well as the effect that each variable has on the GPA score.

Finally, we wanted to see the effects that a student;s stress level had on their GPA. We were able to execute this by first, categorizing the stress levels in 3 different categories; low, medium, and high. We wanted to look at the frequency distribution for stress levels before performing any analysis, so we created a bar plot that looked at the amount of students that fall into each of the categories to get a better understanding of the distribution of students across the school. We then converted these inputs into integers and regressed GPA on these stress levels by creating dummy variables. We omitted one category as the reference category and included two regressors to explain all 3 of our stress levels. Again, we provided our OLS Regression Results where we were able to see the statistical significance of each stress level and the effects that it has on GPA. We then created a Wellness Index using our independent variables by combining them into a single score that was used to assess the overall wellness of students. We did this by normalizing the features and then combining them into a single index now that all the variables are on the same scale. Doing this allowed us to regress GPA on this wellness index and see the relationship between the two and also regress our Wellness Index on the stress levels to examine the relationship that the two had. Again for both of these regressions, we displayed the OLS Regression Results.

As a result of our EDA, we found the relationships between each variable and GPA of our dataset. In a series of regression analyses we found that study hours was the only variable with a positive relationship with GPA, with sleep and extracurricular hours showing no significant relationship, and social and physical activity actually showing a slightly negative correlation. In a more comprehensive regression model, it showed that the different variables showed 54.5% of the variation in GPA with social and physical activity hours having the strongest impact, in terms of a relationship with GPA. So, while our hypothesis of engaging in at least 150 minutes per day of physical activity will positively impact GPA among college students was proven inaccurate, it was clear in our analysis highly suggests that a culmination of all variables combined influence GPA in meaningful ways.

Limitations: Our project has numerous limitations that must be acknowledged. Firstly, our dataset was based on participants in India, which introduces potential external factors such as lifestyle, grading systems, and cultural contexts that may differ from college students in the United States, potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, since the data on study hours, extracurricular activities, sleep, social hours, and physical activity are self-reported, they are prone to biases such as under reporting and over reporting. Participants may inaccurately recall or intentionally misreport their behaviors, which may not reflect their actual daily routines. Furthermore, the study doesn’t fully account for certain confounding variables such as mental health, socioeconomic status, and access to educational resources, which could significantly impact both exercise habits and academic performance. Lastly, the lack of detailed information on the types and intensity of physical activity limits our ability to explore how specific types of exercise may impact GPA.

To dive deeper into our project in the future, we think that it could be beneficial to further verify our findings by analyzing more datasets, with participants in varying regions. In addition, it would also be beneficial to analyze datasets which clearly specify the types of physical activity. This would allow us to analyze how different intensities of physical activity might affect academic performance and further test our hypothesis.
